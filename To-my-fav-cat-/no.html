                To one of the most special person ive met, Your presence would really lit up anyone's day, my life was going super fast but then i met you, time slowed down like a romantic movie, I remember everything vividly sona, your eyebrows and the mark on it, your lil lips, the way you walk, how you look when u get mad, you slapping the shit outta me, your legendary blue nails and your baggy jeans along with ur bag which i once dropped on water hehehee, all those late night drunk calls, I MISS CALLING YOU AFTER GETTING DRUNK, hey ukw you gotta acknowledge me for not calling you recently even tho i got drunk....give ya boi some creditss.... days with you was nothing but beautiful whenever I think about it. That moment when i held your hands it was more special than all the kisses, that day i fell for you and i saw u turning ur face and blushing away it all feels like a movie to me now when i think about it.
                
                <p>Thanks for being there even if it wasn't for that long, I really appreciate you for everything u did, every single message you've sent&#x1F90D;. All them phone calls and meet ups while it was raining...whenever I'm gon think about this year (2023) sona, you're definitely gonna be one of the main reasons to remember it.(2024 moye moye)
                </p>

    <p></p>while you were away, your absence made my hopeless romantic radar go sky rocket level..but Sona that one week you saw isn't really who I am, I'd literally do anything to see your face&#x1F90D;, Ups and downs are all part of it but I'm the same guy now who went out w you during June July...I'm the same guy who waited a year to get a message back from you.... I'd travel a 100kms just to see your face now. I'd literally come and say hi to your balcony everyday after work, I don't sleep early nowadays, it started when we broke up but then later I got two cutest tiny Lil creatures and they're nocturnal so they get all active at night... they have no clue about anything they just be like " what the fuck is this guy talking about" but yea I do talk to them about youuuuu... sometimes I even beatbox at them and they'll just run away...
    <p>What I did was not okay and I wish time travel was real so that id go back and take a day off from work and go somewhere that whole day and I'd have called you whole day, Ion give a shit about other girls for me it was all you that looked precious to me, if God came down and asked me for to choose one person for the next three thousand years, I'd choose you over all the people i know..thats how awesome you are...

    <p>

    </p>You are the greatest cat of all time, best ever to ever exist simply & if there's only one ig page which i could subscribe to id be yours without even a second though &#x1F497;, there;s nothing on earth that looks soo adorable and also at the same time its human, its gotta be you...!.If this was a perfect world I'd run to come and see you near ur clg and I'd hug you and take you to my Maadi and give you bigg biggg hugsss and kisses ( again nothing haram)....it's really weird Im forgetting ur voice and smell. I forgot how to even kiss or give hickeys but I really want to hold ur face and squish youuu.. play with ur cheeks and lips and hold you close while I kiss you, i wanna give you a thousand kisses on ur cheeks and thousand more on ya paws and literally carry you around like a lil cat&#x1F497;&#x1F497;&#x1F497;&#x1F497;.... there's a lot of things which feels like incomplete in many way like u going on God mode all of a sudden in one day, and I haven't taught u how to swing nunchaks or teach ya swimming...and we haven't danced in clubs...we should go for a 2days trip to somewhere- I always wanted to..it's just alot of things feels incomplete.......
    
    <p></p>I feel like im having a sona fever for big time now...and i was never blabbering in those voice texts, you do really mean alot more than just a gf, not just now but the whole time you were more then a gf...you are like dhasavadharam kamal hassan but as a gf, you play many roles not just as gf but more and more(just dont make me sink down in the ocean),  you are the complete package one could ask for...Sona ur absence has just made me more lovely and kind- I thought I'd be completely heartbroken and I'd be like those gym Bois who hit the gym after breakup..but no it's just you opened something in me and it just doesn't want to give it to someone else i guess, idk i just feel like you did a magic on me......
 
when u got drunk and came to see me- idk if u remember the whole day but I just couldn't take my eyes of you, you were glowing like THE PRETTIEST EVERRR, prettier than the sun behind the wallpaper frr - like an energetic being and you attracted me way too much.
<p>

</p> I remember I was like asking u out indirectly but ur drunk ass said - broo Naa pasangala pathaley paanjuruven broo"- IT was so cute when you said thatt i was like awwwww i wanna bite her..not for u to paanjufy on guys but u were just simply kyuut but also I was like aight she high today we'll do it someother time nu, then the next day we met near metro and I asked you out and rest was the best days of my life...........

<p><P>

</P>
 </p>
<p></p>whatever happened happened but yea you do anything you want, go out w anyone you want..do onlyfans(joke)...go party...make a thousand friends...but " you know my dialogue here "...... wish you could just slap me and give me few kisses after all I'm just a mannpuzhuuu but ig thats how not things work anymore...
 
There's chances that you might have not opened this whole page, read all the lines because you might be having semesters or some other work. Or maybe u just didn't want to. But yea I have given all I had, I don't know anything else to win you back...umm I mean it's ur bday so u might be reading all these but.....so yea idk what else I could do to win you back Lil cat..but I'd do anything for you (except tattoos). Mistakes happened i've realised i wasnt being all lovey dovey or auwuwu nu but i really like you more than the height of the Eiffel Tower and bigger than the size of the Titanic &#x1F90D;
 
<p>
<p>
    <p>
        Btw you might think whys he doing all this, i remember you said once you like it when the guy says sorry/please nu so i just did it all i could and got on my knees for you....and also i got this fight till the end mindset so i cant help but im trying
    </p>
</p>

</p>
Other day a birdo came to me and said &#x1F90D;- "universe sent me and it wants you to send your love to Sona"....so here I am with all my guards down. Looking at you with hearty eyes and holding your paws........
 
If you ever change your mind, paint ur nails blue and come see me. If you won't change your mind then paint ur nails yellow and give me a kiss&#x1F497;.</p>

                You're an angel with the cutest smile ever, even a man hunting demon would melt away looking at you, and totally change into a kid around you, thats what happened to me- the first moment i saw you i just knew something and yea im leaving the rest to the universe. but you dont know girl, u aint from earth, you're def from up above &#x1F5A4;
              <p> 
                <p></p>
                There can be few things special about someone but it's just everything about you is so special. You and ur silly roasting skills going up against someone almost 7yrs older than ya and roasting them. its one of the main reasons i like you, you can roast like a mf - it was like dating my own self sometimes and i believe we did roast eachother mostly 24/7 but our bond was also  till the last moment...If there's a hundred girls standing on the stage, 10 would get the main attention, 5 would look almost attractive and similar to each other. In the remaining 5, three would be dickheads, but those two leftâ€” they'd be cute as hell and also have a personality that anyone would fall in love with. You are exactly that and out of those 2, 1 would be a cat like ya&#x1F497;. I don't think there are many girls like you. May God send more sweethearts like you to Earth.  If I could wish to experience one moment again and again with the same exact feeling, it would be when I held your hands in that metro station for the first time. I've tried weed, alcohol, and all that, but holding your hands â€“ nothing beats that. Not the boxing fights, but holding your hands, my heart went twice as fast, pounding and this feeling of finally after all that waiting im holding the hands of the girl i had a crush on for so long and woaahh it was idek the right words, im dead bro im done that was  like a life time settlement moment.</p>
<P>

</P>
                <P>
                     <P></P>

                </p>
                I wish I had something that belongs to you, like a souvenir. The reason I asked for that Varkala shirt was that I thought your scent would be on it bc u wore it at home. At that time, if I asked for any of your clothes, you definitely wouldn't have given me anything; you were like on fire. But yeah, it doesnt have ur scent on it......
            <p>   
                   </p> 
                
                 
                 
<p> </p>
    
</p>
            <p>   The other day i gave you back those certificates, but they didnt give you the certificate for the best cat in the world. But yea you deserve one :) </p>
        </p>  
<p>
 </p>
       <p>You are a piece of art &#x1F90D;, you're like those mountains and lakes, there's nothing can be done about it,it requires nothing to change there but we're just grateful for those places to simply exist, thats how beautiful and precious you are. god bless ya parents for making you.&#x1F30D;
        <p></p>
        anyways, its 9th of december, 2023 ends this month, you are the person i really wanted to be around with in 2024 and beyond. My old best friend, gf, alabama sibling, youre def like a family to me and i love you
