                Hey Nithya&#x1F90D;, 
            </p>
            <p>Things happened and it wasnt cool and you did the right thing by cutting off the communication and it made me understand how much you mean to me, im kinda glad it happened because id have never know how important you are to me if we didnt have this break.
                <p>
                    Back then i panicked and i pushed you away even further, it doesnt even look like it was me when i look back at things but i hope you're now all chill & i wanted to just have this convo with you.
                </p>
           
            </p>I put you thro a lot but trust me i never wanted things to go bad like this, sorry about that whole week i was not in my sense tbh...i tried to be good but i fell off the wagon big time, ive been loyal to you when u were with me and even when u werent around i was being loyal to you, you mean alot to me and no one can even come close to how much you mean to me&#x1F90D;.<p></p> <p>

            </p> so i'll leave it upto you, obviously life has to move on i cant be like this forever but i just felt from my heart to write you these paras. I'll respect your decision if you dont want anything but if you just get to know me better after this break - <p>
            </p>
            <p>
       
            </p>I genuinely want to have this talk with you, i'm not sure if you'll open my msgs or my website - so you gotta excuse me in advance if i drop u a call to get ur attention, alot changed, Well anyways i took ur advice and i shaved my beard - I might get a modelling contract soon ahahaaa jk (Not), back then i might have shown alot of emotion to you but it is what it is, your boi had a phase. <p>

            </p> I had an idle phase but Something sparked within me and ever since that moment im working my ass off(btw i did get abs back 11days after our break), im prioritizing my looks and physique, I aint the same guy u stop talking to. im back to my best mindset and i would literally do anything for you, i'd defend you against the whole world id even fight a bear for you, and if you see me fight a bear, help the bear.<p>

                <p>
        </p>I would run many miles to see you again, days and nights have passed, sometimes im slowly tryna let you go for my own good but deep down i just know that things aint done and not a single day went by where i didnt think about you...
        <p>

            <p>I miss those unplanned meet ups, i miss your stories, your perfume, i miss those bike rides and i really want you to say hello to my new pets they are so lovely, i miss hearing about your friends, jyothsna, sruthi all of them i really wanna hangout and chill like the other day.</p>
            
       
                <p>
                   I had this empty feeling in me, like physically i was alright, i had plenty of things to keep me distracted 24/7 but the only thing i kept looking at everyday was just checking my mobile to see if you have texted me. My life's good im blessed with alot of things but when your best bud aint around, it aint really legendary right? I wanna tell you all the stories and also i wanna listen to yours, how many events did you win recently, how's it all going, and you got an iphone ig? i wanna know what youve been upto recently, im pretty sure you did alot of things ......
                </p>
            </p>
        </p>we had one big fight, and its all on me. But as a man i was really willing to fix things tbh and i was ready to do whatever it takes<p>
        <!-- <p>So at chai shop near eekatuthangal, place where we met after u won that trophy remember? the one with good puffs ? there you'll see a tall handsome guy with long hair with No glasses, and he's probably got the BIGGEST CRUSH ON YOU and you are the favorite cat to him, he'll be sitting and having a tea, ya shud probably go say hi~( I'll tell him not to hug and crush ya w big hugs dw) 7.30 to 8.30 I'll be there for you, date ~ Feb 14, 2024, Wednesday ig. -->
            <p>

            </p> I wont expect you to be all chill sona, I got nothing against you bc youre as perfect as the nature, if youre mad at me, grab me by my shirt and hit me im all yours, for my eyes you are a kozhandha to me doesnt matter if ur 20 or 25, I wish you let me make it up to you.<p>
    <p>
        <p>
            Its not like im gonna ask you to come back to me again and date me like nothing happened also you know i would never be in anything serious, Im totally a new guy both in and out- and i havent cut my hair ever since we last met (Thanks for ur suggestion it really suits me) i've swtched to a quiet and calm character. <p>


            
            </p>Not much but i wish i could call you when im drunk, I wanna give you back that varkala shirt it doesnt have ur scent on it,maybe teach ya how to do nunchaks, I really wanted to have a goofy time w you- being all spontaneous, felt really nice to hangout w you, wish i went for trip w you in train (aight dont freak out here) ~ i just want peace and be chill w you and im doing alot of things but when my best bud aint around to look at it, it doesnt feel the same but yea cool.
            <p>

<p> Things written below was wrote of that feeling when u miss someone and i really meant it all when i wrote it so i dont wanna change anything abt it :</p>
            </p> Ima teach you how to box, jiu jutsu every skill i've learnt and ima make you a ninja and you can teach me the things you know(i might get distracted and id just stare at your face like "awww she is so cute"). Oh i saw this prettiest picture of you in white outfit with that small flower over ur ear while i was just scrolling thro my whatsapp&#x1F90D;YOU LOOKED PRETTY LIKE A FLOWER.
            <p></p> Ima give you the warmest of all hugs, gentlest kisses on your hands while driving, more neck attacks, and many "more" things as romantic as possible. I'll look at you in a way no guy has ever looked at you out of love. Gimme the passes to hold you by your face and attack you w love.
            <p></p> Gimme the passes to pull ya close when we're alone in the lift. gimme passes to bite your neck ( YOUR NECK IS THE MOST MAGICAL THING ON EARTH), allow me to carry you on my back- and yes ima bet u that i can carry you and walk for 10mins def(maybe if you sneak in a few kisses i might carry you for hours),I'll ensure you'd feel adored as a princess, Ima wake you up with kisses and ima give you more kissy when you feel sleepy, and you can absolutely do anything you want because, <p>

            </p>
